 <h2>Hello World! I'm Imani</h2>

  Hello World! Welcome to my Blog! My name is Imani Clarke. I'm 21 years old and I am a student at 
  the University of the West Indies in the beautful land of wood and water, Jamaica, and I am pursuing a 
  Bachelor's degree in Computer Science #BlackGirlinTech. My dream is to become a Web Developer and
  a UI/UX Designer and I'm currently being on the track to make these dreams a reality.</p> 
  <p> My hobbies aside from learning coding include dancing, binging watching movies(huge Marvel Cinematic Universe fan!) and kdramas, 
  stanning BTS, hanging with my friends, and planning trips to places I hope I can afford to travel to in the near future. The 
  programming languages I am learning are HTML, CSS and Javascript. </p>

 <h2>My Web Development and UI/UX Journey </h2>

  <img src="UX.jpeg" alt="UX image">
   Before I discovered Web Development and UI/UX I was a clueless 1st year computing student lost in the sea of the many I.T careers out there. 
   Combating that along with my general inexperience with coding(a skill every computing student should have *cries in imposter syndrome*)I was like a 
   fish out of water.At first I had a very cliche view of what it looked like working in Tech. I pictured the stereotypical dude with glasses and all 
   the theatrics, I wasn't like that, at all.So I had to do some thinking and research and ask myself "What do you actually want to do Imani?"</p>    
    <p> I knew I didn't want to do any of that machine learning stuff *barf* nor the Math *double barf*, but alas I knew what I
   wanted to be apart of. I wanted to create things that would be useful for someone, I cared alot about what a user would experience
   with a product and I liked the fact that I would be able to be apart of a team that could create something that could directly affect 
   a user. Hence, my venture into Web Development and UI/UX was born :D. And as a complete beginner it's a long journey ahead of learning but I can't
   wait to experience it.</p>
